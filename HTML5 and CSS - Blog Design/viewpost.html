                        <h2>Why choosing the Right Storage Infrastracture</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>
                        As IT staff deploy virtual machines at an exponential rate, they inevitably reach the performance limits of the spinning disks, exceeding maximum storage IOPS before reaching maximum capacity. As a result, a significant amount of capacity is left unutilized.

                        Consider the four main components of virtualization: CPU, memory, network and disk storage. CPU power continues to increase in accordance with Moore’s Law, doubling approximately every two years by providing an ever increasing number of processing cores and clock speeds. We also see memory sizes increasing rapidly owing to low-cost RAM modules and faster connectivity such as 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 8Gb Fibre Channel and 40Gb InfiniBand. All of this allows more VMs to be deployed at increased levels of performance.

                        When we look at disk technology, however, classic spinning disks remain limited by their mechanical components, constraining the number of IOPS and thus the number of VMs they can support. Although SSD technology will alter this relationship, it is unlikely to become mainstream as primary storage for several years because of cost/capacity constraints and reliability concerns. So, as the IT industry’s thirst for greater numbers of VMs grows, it puts significant pressure on storage infrastructure—an issue that can only be addressed by more-efficient design.
